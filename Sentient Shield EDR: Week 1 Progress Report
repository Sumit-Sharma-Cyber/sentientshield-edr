Sentient Shield EDR: Week 1 Progress Report
🛡️ Project Overview Sentient Shield is an enterprise-grade Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) grid designed to protect the Infotact Solutions infrastructure. This project leverages Wazuh to provide real-time visibility, log analysis, and automated response across multiple operating systems.

👥 Team Roles & Responsibilities

Sumit Sharma (Infrastructure Lead): Core SOC deployment, Docker orchestration, and centralized manager configuration.

Chinmai Raj (Linux Analyst): Linux endpoint monitoring, hardening, and Debian-based agent integration.

Dhananjaysinh (Windows Engineer): Windows agent deployment, Sysmon v15.15 integration, and Microsoft environment telemetry.

🛠️ Week 1: Infrastructure Milestones

1. SOC Manager Deployment

Platform: Deployed Wazuh using Docker on a Kali Linux host (192.168.204.129).

Conflict Resolution: Resolved port 443 conflicts with the local Apache service to bring the Dashboard online.

2. Multi-OS Agent Enrollment

Linux Node: Enrolled Lead-kali-EDR. Status: Active.

Windows Node: Enrolled Analyst-Win-EDR (Windows 11). Status: Active.

Telemetry Grid: Established a secure heartbeat connection over port 1514 (TCP).

3. Deep Visibility Integration (EDR Upgrade)

Sysmon Implementation: Deployed Microsoft Sysmon on the Windows endpoint to capture advanced telemetry.

Log Routing: Manually reconfigured ossec.conf to ingest the Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational event channel, enabling tracking of process creation and network connections.

📈 Dashboard Status

Total Agents: 2

Active Agents: 2 (Lead-kali-EDR & Analyst-Win-EDR)

Monitoring Capabilities: Real-time log analysis, File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), and Advanced Process Tracking (Sysmon) are now operational.

🛡️ What We Accomplished in Week 1

1. Cross-Platform Orchestration We successfully moved from a single-node manager to a multi-OS monitoring grid. The Sentient Shield can now ingest and correlate logs from both Linux and Windows environments simultaneously.

2. Achieving "Deep Visibility" By integrating Sysmon, we upgraded our Windows monitoring from basic event logging to full EDR capability. We can now see exactly what commands are run, who ran them, and what network ports they opened.

3. Establishing the Communication Beacon The Manager at 192.168.204.129 is successfully receiving heartbeats every 10 seconds from all endpoints, ensuring near-instantaneous detection of agent downtime or attacks.

4. Repository & Configuration Integrity Configuration files for both Linux and Windows agents, including the custom Sysmon log-channel edits, have been synced to the GitHub repository.
